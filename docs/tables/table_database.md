# Table Database

The table files `.tbl`, located under `system/table` holds most of the data for the game. Items, abilities, gems (sigils), and a lot more. 

In order to make it easier for editing, it is recommended to first convert them to [SQLite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite) for easier manipulation.

!!! danger

    Do **NOT** use this online. Likewise, do **NOT** use this to create and publish cheat related mods, such as skill edits. 

    Table research and edits should be reserved to adding or adjusting content. Using mods with table edits has a **high** potential for breakage if used online. If you are publishing a mod with table edits, only include the table files you've edited in your mod, **not ALL the tables**. 

    **Mention which tables you have edited when publishing your mod**. Otherwise multiple mods may conflict if they edit the same table.

## Converting to SQLite

To convert them to SQLite, you can use [GBFRDataTools](https://github.com/Nenkai/GBFRDataTools) >1.2.0 which you should already have.

``` markdown title="Command"
GBFRDataTools.exe tbl-to-sqlite -i <path to table folder> -o <output SQLite file> -v <game version i.e 1.1.1>
```

You can then preview them using any SQLite database editor, such as [SQLiteStudio](https://sqlitestudio.pl/)

!!! tip

    If you care about your eyes, switch to Dark Mode in:
    
    * Tools :material-arrow-right: Open configuration dialog :material-arrow-right: Look & feel (Style) :material-arrow-right: Current style: Fusion Dark.

## Converting back to .tbl

!!! note
    
    Make sure you've read the danger notice above.


``` markdown title="Command"
GBFRDataTools.exe sqlite-to-tbl -i <path to SQLite file> -o <path of output table folder> -v <game version i.e 1.1.1>
```

## Additional Notes

* A list of tables is available [here](table_list.md)
* For random-looking-values, [Hashes](../resources/re/hashes.md) are used for table relationships. Blank columns signify a hash of `887AE0B0` (empty string/no value).
* The actual type of each column can be found by inspecting the `.headers` files of GBFRDataTool under the `Headers` folder.
* Many of the columns are unknown and may need to be figured out first.
* **Please contribute!** There are many tables that have yet to be figured out. The headers are located [here](https://github.com/Nenkai/GBFRDataTools/tree/master/GBFRDataTools.Database/Headers) on the repo **and you might find some extra comments for certain tables**. For hashes, if you manage to bruteforce the original string for certain hashes, the list is located [here](https://github.com/Nenkai/GBFRDataTools/blob/master/GBFRDataTools.Database/Data/ids.txt).

### Easy Searching

You might find yourself how to identity where certain ids (or hashes) are used between tables. If you have query knowledge you could add a function that makes it easy to find where certain cells are used.

* In SQLiteStudio, find the "Open SQLite functions editor" window. Press the `+`.
* Set the function name as `find`, make sure `Type` is Scalar and `Implementation language` is **Tcl**.
* In `Input arguments`, Press the `+` such as you have one `argument`
* In `Function implementation code`, insert the following:

```batch
set value [string map [list "'" "''"] [lindex $argv 0]]
set results [list]

foreach table [db eval {select name from sqlite_master where type = "table"}] {
    set table $table
    set cols [list]
    foreach {cid colName colType colNN colDef colPk} [db eval "PRAGMA table_info('$table')"] {
        lappend cols "\[$colName\] = '$value'"
    }
    if {[catch {
        set res [db eval "SELECT rowid FROM \[$table\] WHERE [join $cols { OR }]"]
        if {[llength $res] > 0} {
            return "found in table $table in rows with following ROWID: [join $res ,\ ]"
        }
    }]} {
        set res [db eval "SELECT count(*) FROM \[$table\] WHERE [join $cols { OR }]"]
        if {[lindex $res 0] > 0} {
           lappend results '$table'
        }
    }
}
return "[join $results {, }]"
```

You can now use the SQL Editor/Querier with `SELECT find("<value>")`, which will return where said value is referenced.
