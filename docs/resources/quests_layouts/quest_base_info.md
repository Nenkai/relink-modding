|--------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------|

### Target

List of available current objectives in the quest.

| Attribute                | Type       | Description                                        |
|--------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `label_`                 | `string`   | **Unique key of the target**.
| `textLabel_`             | `string`   | Localized text.
| `type_`                  | `int`      | Type of objective display value.
| `id_`                    | `int`      | Id (when applicable), i.e Enemy [Object Id](../re/obj_id.md).
| `count_`                 | `int`      | Count.
| `canFail_`               | `bool`     | Whether this target/objective is failable.
| `isDisplay_`             | `bool`     | Whether this is displayed.

| `udsId_`                 | `int`      | Unknown.

The value `canFail_` perhaps doesn't have the best name. It seems rather more
accurate to say it acts as a `shouldFail` signal. When set to true, then a
failure will be triggered for this objective once the condition determined by
this objective's `type_` attribute has been met.

`isDisplay_` doesn't seem to have any hard rules, either. For a quest's three
typical objectives, `isDisplay_` is usually set to true, except for when using
either `type_` for displaying text strings, ironically. Some objectives do have
hidden objectives, however, which can be used to trigger additional rewards.

`type_` can take on many different (integer) values to indicate a multitude of
different quest objectives. Known values are enumerated in the table below. Note
that for many or most of these, the `id_` field isn't used and is expected to be `0`.
